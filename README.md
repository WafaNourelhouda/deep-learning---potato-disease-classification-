# Potato Disease Classification

Farmers often face economic losses and crop waste due to diseases in potato plants, with Early Blight and Late Blight being major concerns. These diseases significantly contribute to the loss in potato yield. This project aims to classify potato leaf images into three classes:

1. Healthy leaves
2. Late Blight leaves
3. Early Blight leaves


## Problem Statement

The primary goal is to provide a solution to the economic challenges faced by farmers by accurately identifying and classifying potato leaves affected by Early Blight and Late Blight. This classification system can assist farmers in taking timely actions to mitigate the impact of these diseases on crop yield.

## Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3utJFNGyBpIvjWgSDY0eOE8S), which provides valuable insights and tutorials on image classification using machine learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, TensorFlow, and any additional libraries required for image processing and machine learning.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
